## What is the Hashrate of the Nebra Hotspots?

Due to how HNT works, coins are not mined traditionally where a hashrate affects the amount earned. How it is earned is explained on the [Helium Website](https://www.helium.com/mine).</details>

## How much HNT will my hotspot earn?
<details> <summary>Click to expand! </summary>

Compared to other cryptocurrencies there isn't a constant amount of HNT earned per day by the units due to the variations on a setup to setup basis.

To get a rough idea, we recommend to have a look at the [Helium Explorer](https://explorer.helium.com/coverage) at other hotspots in your area.</details>
