## Daughterboard Jumpers

**JP3 - Power Jumper**
JP3 connects the 5V from the Micro USB port to the 5V rail of the compute module. This enables the USB Switching circuitry and switches it into programming USB Mode.

**This should only be connected if you are connecting the daughterboard to a computer to re-program the CM3.**

**JP4 - Onboard Flash Jumper**
This jumper is used in conjunction with JP3 to put the CM3 into programming mode which disables the onboard flash and sets the CM3 into a mode where it is ready to receive data via USB.

**For normal operation the jumper should be in position 1+2**
