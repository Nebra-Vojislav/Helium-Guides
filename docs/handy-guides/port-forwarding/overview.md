# Port Forwarding for your Helium Hotspot

Helium Hotspots ideally require a port to be forwarded on the network to work at their best, to help with this us and the community have put together a bunch of guides to try and cover as many network setups as possible.


# Guide List

 - Virgin Media Super Hub V3

To make getting running as easy as possible, we'd love it if you could help document your network's system.

To do this fork our Documentation repository on github at https://github.com/NebraLtd/Helium-Guides , create the relevant guide and submit a PR.

We recommend you refer to the Virgin Media Super Hub V3 guide as an example of what we're looking for.

Some basic guidelines are:

* Ideally we're looking at keeping to ISP provided routers as these are the most popular. Some other popular brands would be good to have too but primarily we're looking at ones provided by ISPs.
* No repeat guides please, first check if your router combo has been added.
* Please create the guide with a name that won't collide. In the case of us documenting the Virgin Media Superhub V3 we used `vm-superhub-v3.md`
* Please put all screenshots in the `/media/port-forwarding/` directory.
* Please use a format of the same name used for the markdown guide, with -XX being numbered of each screenshot. An example would be for our Virgin Media guide `vm-superhub-v3-01.png`
* Ideally but not essential, have all screenshots in PNG format.
