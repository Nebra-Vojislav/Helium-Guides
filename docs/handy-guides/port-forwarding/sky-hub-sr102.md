# Sky Hub SR102 Port Forwarding Guide

The Sky Hub SR102 is one of the most common ISP provided routers in the UK. It is fairly locked down as to what you are able to do, as routers go, however it does provide the ability to configure static IPs and port forwarding in a pretty intuitive way. It is important to set a static IP before setting up port forwarding, so that the router knows where to forward the traffic to and that the local IP address of the device always stays the same.

Firstly, you need to look on the bottom of your router and check what the management IP and password are of the router. If your router is in a cupboard or somewhere a bit annoying to reach, it can sometimes help to take a picture of the info on the sticker on the bottom of the router so you can easily refer to it later. Usually, if you have not changed the management IP, it will be `192.168.0.1` on the Hub Sky Hub. The default username is `admin` and default password is `sky` and this should be the same as long as you have not changed these details.
