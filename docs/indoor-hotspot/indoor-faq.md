## What is the antenna connector on the Hotspot?

The indoor unit has a RP-SMA Female Connector on, and the outdoor unit has an N-Type female connector on.



## Can I add 4G connectivity to my Indoor Hotspot?

No, the indoor unit does not have the ability to have a 4G Modem added, you could use a solution like a MiFi or 4G to Ethernet module to achieve the same result.

## How much internet data per month does the Hotspot use?


Currently we are roughly estimating 30-50GB per month.
  
The actual usage may be slightly less or more and will be something we up-date over time as we start measuring more units.
  
Once all hotspots become "light hotspots" this data usage will reduce.


## What antenna is included with the Hotspot?


A 3dBi Omni-directional antenna is included with the Nebra Indoor Hotspot, specifications can be found on the [overview page](../indoor-hotspot/overview.md).

Upgraded antennas can be [purchased separately from our website](https://www.nebra.com/collections/antennas).


## Can I use PoE with the Indoor Hotspot?

If you wish to use PoE with the Indoor Hotspot you will require an active PoE splitter that outputs 12V to the unit. Alternatively you can use passive PoE adapters as long as the power provided to the unit is between 9 and 16 Volts and can provide 15W of power.


## How long does it take for my Hotspot to sync with the network?


This can vary depending on your internet connection speed. However, in our testing it takes approximately 24-48 hours for the initial synchronisation to be completed.



## How to remount the indoor miner daughter board?


* **Step 1:** On 1st gen design (dark grey case with white logo) - remove the screws from the bottom of the case to take off the lid. On second gen design (gloss black plastic case) - unclip the lid from the base (there are 4 clips, one in each corner).
* **Step 2:** Re-insert the daughter board into the 60 pin header and then reassemble 

That's all, you should be good to go. 

Here's a short video showing you how to re-mount the daughterboard...

## How to fix lose antenna connector?


This can be rectified by first removing  the 4 screws to take the lid off. Then use a pair of needle nose pliers or an M8 spanner, along with another M8 Spanner the other side to tighten it up.
