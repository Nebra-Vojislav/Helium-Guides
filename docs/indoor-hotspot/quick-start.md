### Preparing Your Nebra Indoor Hotspot

**Step 1:** First screw in the included antenna into the connector on the back of the hotspot.

**Step 2:** Next find a suitable location for your Hotspot to be positioned, to provide the best coverage we recommend placing it near a window just out of direct sunlight. You’ll need to be near a mains power source too.

**Step 3:** If you are using a wired ethernet connection, connect an ethernet cable between a router or switch and the ethernet jack on the Hotspot.

**Step 4:** Fit the appropriate power plug for your country onto the universal power supply and plug it into a mains outlet.

**Step 5:** Finally connect the DC Jack from the power supply into the power receptacle on the Hotspot.

You should then see the lower LED on the back of the unit turn on, the hotspot will now take up to 5 minutes to configure for it’s first boot.

The upper light will turn on when it is ready to continue for configuration.

If you have connected it to a wired ethernet connection this process may take slightly longer as it’ll also perform firmware updates as soon as it gets a connection to the internet.
