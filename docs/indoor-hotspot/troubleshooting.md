You should see the lower light on the back of the unit turn on as soon as power is applied.
If this is the case, ensure the power supply is firmly plugged into the wall outlet, the power jack is plugged into the unit and that the wall outlet is switched on.

Upon power up the lower LED (yellow) should light up instantly. Approximately after a minute the top LED (green) should then start blinking.

### My hotspot is not showing in the Helium App

It can sometimes take 1 minute from turning the power on for the Hotspot to show in the App.
Re-scanning a few times can then find the hotspot.

Ensure Bluetooth is turned on as this is how the application communicates with your Hotspot.

You will have had to have granted location permissions for the Application to access Bluetooth services correctly.

You may find that sometimes your Wi-Fi network may not show in the application if the signal is poor where the Hotspot is located.

If after completing initial troubleshooting steps above, you are still having issues.

You may find your issues can be resolved by ensuring it is running the latest up to date software.

Nebra Hotspots automatically update once connected to the internet, if you are using an Ethernet connection leaving the hotspot for around half an hour should ensure all updates are downloaded.

If you are having difficulties connecting your Hotspot to Wi-Fi, then it would be recommended to move it to a location where you can plug it into an Ethernet connection for half an hour to let it perform updates. Then move it back to the normal location and re-try setup.
