## What is the antenna connector on the Hotspot?

The indoor unit has a **RP-SMA Female** Connector on. 


## Can I add 4G connectivity to my Indoor Hotspot?

No, the indoor unit does not have the ability to have a 4G Modem added, you could use a solution like a MiFi or 4G to Ethernet module to achieve the same result.

## How much internet data per month does the Hotspot use?

Currently we are roughly estimating 30-50GB per month.
  
The actual usage may be slightly less or more and will be something we up-date over time as we start measuring more units.
  
Once all hotspots become "light hotspots" this data usage will reduce.


## What antenna is included with the Hotspot?


A 3dBi Omni-directional antenna is included with the Nebra Indoor Hotspot, specifications can be found on the [overview page](../indoor-rockpi-hotspot/overview.md).

Upgraded antennas can be [purchased separately from our website](https://www.nebra.com/collections/antennas).


## Can I use PoE with the Indoor Hotspot?

If you wish to use PoE with the Indoor Hotspot you will require an active PoE splitter that outputs 12V to the unit. Alternatively you can use passive PoE adapters as long as the power provided to the unit is between 9 and 16 Volts and can provide 15W of power.


## How long does it take for my Hotspot to sync with the network?


This can vary depending on your internet connection speed. However, in our testing it takes approximately 24-48 hours for the initial synchronisation to be completed.


## What is differnce between regular indoor hotspot and ROCK-Pi Indoor Hotspot? 

ROCK Pi hotspot is new series of Nebra hotspot with more RAM, Inbuilt storage and  improved performance.
