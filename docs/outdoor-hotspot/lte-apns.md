# Mobile Network APN List

Here's a list of APNs we have collected for configuring your 4G / LTE modem. This is intended to be used as a quick reference but is far from being a complete and exhaustive list. 

* [Australia](#australia)
* [Canada](#canada)
* [Chile](#chile)
* [France](#france)
* [Italy](#italy)
* [Spain](#spain)
* [United Kingdom](#united-kingdom)
* [United States](#united-states)
* [Worldwide](#worldwide)


If your network isn't listed here we recommend you speak to a customer service representative from your network provider and ask them for their APN settings, alternatively you can often find them via a Google search. 

If you find working APN settings for a network that is not listed here we would be really grateful if you could submit them to us via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/NebraLtd/Helium-Guides/issues/new) or edit the file and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/NebraLtd/Helium-Guides/pulls).
