# Outdoor Hotspot FAQs

## Can I add 4G connectivity to my Outdoor Hotspot?

You can add an optional 4G module to the outdoor hotspot, this is a module that is simple to install when you receive your hotspot. We'll have a guide on how to do this at </outdoor-hotspot/lte-config>

## Does the 4G Module require a sim-card?

Yes you will need to sign up to a data plan with a mobile network. You can find more details about seeing up 4G with the outdoor gateway on the [LTE Config page](outdoor-hotspot/lte-config.md).

We recommend this as it is typically cheaper to sign up to a local plan than the worldwide sims we could ship with it.

## How much internet data per month does the Hotspot use?

Currently we are roughly estimating 30-50GB per month so recommend a 50GB plan when using 4G.

The actual usage may be slightly less or more and will be something we up-date over time as we start measuring more units.
