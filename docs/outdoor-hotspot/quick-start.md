*Please note: You will need a Power Over Ethernet power source (802.3af PoE switch or PoE injector) in order to power the outdoor hotspot. Alternatively, you can use a 12 Volt / 1.5 Amp power supply which can be [purchased separately on our website](https://www.nebra.com/products/nebra-12-volt-1-5-amp-worldwide-power-supply).*

## Warnings

Please remember to follow these important warnings when using your Nebra Outdoor Hotspot:

<div class="tip">

* **<span style="color:red">Never power on the Outdoor hotspot without the grey LoRa antenna connected as this may damage the unit.</span>**
* The Outdoor unit's case is designed to be used outdoors, in all weather conditions, however it is always recommended to protect it from the elements whenever possible especially in harsh environments. Additionally, the outdoor case is not suitable for submerged usage.
* Before installing outside, make sure you have tightened all connectors and the case itself very well to avoid any unintended water ingress.
* The unit should operate without issue even in direct sunlight - however, heat cycling can reduce the service life of the electronics. So where possible it is always recommended to provide some shade for the hotspot case itself.
* It is highly reccommended to provide surge protection both on the antenna connection (to avoid damage to the LoRa concentrator) and on the Ethernet connection (to avoid any onwards damage to your networking equipment in the event of a lightning strike or similar. Please read our [surge protectors](../handy-guides/surge-protectors.md) guide for more information.

**Note:** If you want place your outdoor miner inside, that is entirely fine and will work without issue, however you may want to consider our [indoor hotspot miner](https://www.nebra.com/products/helium-indoor-hotspot-miner) instead.

### Preparing Your Nebra Outdoor Hotspot



**Step 1:** First, carefully screw in the included LoRaWAN antenna (the large, cylindrical antenna, usually grey), to the port at the top of the hotspot. 

You may also have a smaller WiFi antenna (white), that screws into the connection at the bottom of the hotspot, beside the ethernet gland.


**Step 2:** Next find a suitable location for your hotspot to be positioned, to provide the best coverage we recommend placing it on a rooftop, or mast as high as possible. 

Please take all appropriate precautions if working at height, or ask a trained professional to install the hotspot if you are unsure. 

**Step 3:**  You will need to consider how to power the hotspot. By default, it is configured for Power over Ethernet (PoE -  IEEE 802.3af or  IEEE 802.3at), using a switch or PoE injector. 

To power using a DC supply, you may need to open the case to change a jumper clip. (coming soon)



**Step 4:**  Use an ethernet cable connected to your PoE switch or PoE injector, and connect it to the hotspot using an ethernet cable to with the supplied gland, to ensure a watertight (IP68) seal. 

It takes a minute or so to power on, and for the first 10 minutes, the hotspot is discoverable via Bluetooth. 

note: even if you have powered the hotspot using PoE, but there is no network connection, WiFI will still work as usual. 

If you have connected it to a wired Ethernet connection, the process may take slightly longer as itâ€™ll also perform firmware updates as soon as it gets a connection to the internet.


**Step 5:** register your hotspot (see below) and wait for your hotspot to sync the blockchain, this can take a few hours.
